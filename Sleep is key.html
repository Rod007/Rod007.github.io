                <p style="color: #ffffff; ">The secret to getting great sleep has to do with experimenting. Just like playing a video game on a hard difficulty and beating that last boss by finding his weak spot. You will have to find your comfort sleep zone, kind of like a pre game ritual. What works for some might not work as well for others. For example I enjoy having a fan pointed at me so it can cool my body, it helps me sleep better. Other people might not like what I do. It's important to find the sleep strategies that work best for you. 
                Now to get to the basics, how much sleep do you need?.
			Sleep study scientists say that the new guidelines are needed to take into account an abundance of recent research in the field and to reflect that Americans are on average sleeping less than they did in the past.
                        <b>Several sleep studies have found that seven hours is the optimal amount of sleep.</b>"The lowest mortality and morbidity is with seven hours," said Shawn Youngstedt, a professor in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation at Arizona State University Phoenix. "Eight hours or more has consistently been shown to be hazardous," says Dr. Youngstedt, who researches the effects of oversleeping.
                        Other recent research has shown that skimping on a full night's sleep, even by 20 minutes, impairs performance and memory the next day. And getting too much sleep—not just too little of it—is associated with health problems including diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease and with higher rates of death, studies show.

                        <br/> It is good to have a notepad and pen near your bed. The reason for it is when you can't sleep because you are worrying about something. It works for some people to write it down and you should feel relieved. It can help you go back to sleep somewhat peacefully and not with a heavy mind.
